\subsection*{Resource partitioning: \textit{Bombus} bumble bees}

Resource partitioning allows more species to co-occur in a community.
Coexisting species that use one or more resources in the same way compete
with each other for the resources. Competition is reduced if species
use resources in different ways.

\textbf{Build but keep it short}


You will analyze several data sets to explore resource partitioning for five
species of bumble bees in the genus \textit{Bombus.} These data were collected
by Macior (1974), Pyke (1982), and Pyke et~al.~(2012) near Crested Butte, Colorado,
southwest of Denver. \textbf{Put map in pre-lab.}

Researchers walked transects (paths) counting species of bumble bees and the 
species of flowers visited by the bees for pollen and nectar. They walked
three transects and counted a total of 13,136 individuals for 12 species of 
\textit{Bombus} (Pyke 1982).

For simplicity, you'll use data for five of the species most commonly 
sighted along one of the transects.


\subsubsection*{Analysis: proboscis lengths}

Download bombus\_data.xlsx\footnote{All data currently in one
spreadsheet.} and click on the “Proboscis Lengths” tab. These data are
 proboscis lengths measured from 50 individuals for each of five \textit{Bombus} species. All measurements are in millimeters (mm).\footnote{Data simulated 
from results of Macior (1974).}

Use the \texttt{average} function in Excel to calculate the mean $\left(\meanY\right)$ proboscis length for each species. Use the \texttt{stdev.s} function
to calculate the sample standard deviation $\left(s\right)$ for each species. %Use the \texttt{count} and \texttt{sqrt} functions to calculate standard 
%error of the mean. As a reminder, the equation to calculate $\mathrm{SE}_{\meanY}$ is
%
%\begin{equation*} \label{eq:stderr}
%\mathrm{SE}_{\meanY} = \dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
%\end{equation*}
%
%where $s$ is the standard deviation of the sample and $n$ is the sample size.

\subsubsection*{Analysis: proboscis length and corolla length}\label{sec:proboscis_flower_length}

\textbf{Inc. pics of bee proboscis and flower corolla in pre-lab}

Pyke et al.~(2012) measured the corolla lengths for all species of flowers visited by different species and castes (queens, workers, and males) of \textit{Bombus.} You will find the average corolla and proboscis lengths recorded in the “Proboscis and corolla lengths” tab.

\textbf{Consider shiny app to do linear regression?}

\question
Do the results agree with your prediction? Explain.

\AnswerBox{3\baselineskip}{The scatterplot shows two clusters of points. 
\textit{Bombus} species with long proboscises tend to visit plant species with

\subsubsection*{Analysis: flower visitation by \textit{Bombus}}

The scatterplot you made was based on average values for proboscis and corolla 
lengths. Does this mean that \textit{Bombus} visited \emph{only} size-appropriate flowers?  

To answer this question Pyke (1982) recorded the flower species visited by the five \textit{Bombus} species. They recorded 7,161 visits to 34 plant species. Corolla lengths ranged from 0-27.2 mm. You will find their data in the “Flower visits” tab.

To graph the data, Pyke grouped the flowers into four size classes based on corolla length. \textbf{Make up names for size classes?}

0–3.99 mm\newline
4–7.99 mm\newline
8–11.99 mm\newline
12$+$ mm

\question
Tally the number of visits by each species of \textit{Bombus} to each size class of flowers. \textbf{Wording?}

\emph{Follow the following instructions carefully.}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Enter 0 mm, 4 mm, 8 mm, and 12 mm into cell row J1 to M1 (one per cell)
	to represent the \emph{minimum} corolla length needed for each size class.
	
	\item Enter the five species names into column I2 to I6.
	
	\textsc{Calculate} the number of visits by \textit{B.~appositus} to the four
	size classes of flowers. 
	
	\item Click in cell J2, and then use the \textsc{sum} function to add the
	number of flower visits in the \textit{B. appositus} column with corolla
	lengths less than 3.99. For this cell, you should sum cells C28 to C35. 
	(You can sum only the cells with values, if you wish.)
	
	\item Click in cell K2. Sum the values for \textit{B. appositus} for
	all plant species with corolla lengths between 4–8.9 mm. 
	
	\item Click in cell L2 and sum the values for \textit{B. appositus} for
	all plant species with corolla lengths between 8–11.9 mm.
	
	\item Click in cell M2 and sum the values for \textit{B. appositus} for
	all plant species with corolla lengths 12 mm or longer.
	
	\item Repeat this process for the four remaining species. You can ask your instructor to check to be sure your results look correct. 
	
\end{enumerate}

\question
Use the values in your table to sketch separate column charts for the number
of visits to each size class for each species of \textit{Bombus}. Use the

\subsubsection*{Interpret: proboscis length and flower size}

\question[Checkout]
Do the results so far provide evidence of resource partitioning?  Explain. Include all results obtained so far to support your conclusion.

\AnswerBox{2\baselineskip}{So far, the results suggest that partitioning
occurs between species with short versus long proboscises. However, bumble
bees with similar proboscis lengths use similar size flowers.}

\subsubsection*{Conclusion: proboscis length and flower size}

\question[Checkout]
Was your hypothesis supported or falsified? Explain why.

\subsubsection*{Analysis: elevation and relative abundance}

\textbf{should prob have hypothesis and prediction questions here
but have to think of prompting text to lead students in right 
direction. Don't want them to predict which elevations would be
used by species, but simply whether species with similar proboscis
lengths would occupy similar elevations.}

Pyke (1982) noticed that the relative abundance of bees with long 
and short proboscises seemed to change as elevation increased. To 
verify his observations, Pyke calculated the relative abundance
of each species by dividing the number of individuals of
one species by the total number of individuals of all species in
the \emph{same} size class. For example, the relative abundance
of \textit{B. appositus} among long-proboscis bees was calculated by

\begin{equation*}
\dfrac{\mathrm{Number~of}~appositus}{\mathrm{Number~of}~appositus + 
\mathrm{Number~of}~kirbiellus}
\end{equation*}

The Gothic Transect tab has the relative abundance of the five 
\textit{Bombus} species for that transect. The Gothic Transect 
had 17 sites at elevations between 
2,873–3,697~m (9,426–12,129~ft) above sea level. Notice the
distinct change in gradient starting at site 11.

\subsubsection*{Conclusion: resource partitioning}

\question[Checkout]
Describe the evidence you now have and how it supports resource partitioning of flower size and elevation among the five species of 
\textit{Bombus} bumble bees studied here.


\begin{AnswerPage}{0.2\textheight}
The five species of \textit{Bombus} bumble bees partition their
nectar sources based on the length of their proboscises. Species
with shorter proboscises visit smaller flowers more often and 
vice versa for species with long proboscises.

Species with similar lengths of proboscises tend to partition
elevation. At with one species usually dominant at a similar 
elevations. As elevation increases, another species tends to become
more abundant.
