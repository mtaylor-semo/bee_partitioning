# Resource Partitioning by Bumble Bees

Exercise and data for BI 063 students to study resource partitioning.

Students will use data from Pyke 1982 and other sources to analyze resource partitioning among four species of *Bombus* bumble bees: *B. appositus*, *B. kirbyellus*, *B. bifarius*, and *B. frigidus*.


#### Goals

1. Use data from Pkye et al. (2012) to determine relationship between flower corolla size and bumble bee proboscis length.  (Done)

2. Simulate data from Macior (1974; if available) and Pyke (1982) to calculate mean proboscis lengths for four species of bumble bees. (Partial. Have means for three species from Pleasants 1980, which uses Macior's data. Pleasants did not include standard deviations/errors. For now, using 0.1 stdev until I find out if Macior included error terms.)

3. Use data from Pyke (1982) to show resource partitioning between four bumble bee species. (Done)

Data to recreate the bumble bee partitioning figure from [this Nature Scitable article](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/resource-partitioning-and-why-it-matters-17362658/) is taken from [Pkye (1982).](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1938970)

4. Use data from Pyke (1982) to show differences in altitude for the four bumble species. (To do)
